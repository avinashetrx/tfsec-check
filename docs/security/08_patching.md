# Patching

Patching of OS-managed packages is automated using AWS Systems Manager Maintenance Windows.

Other components (vendor application versions, Tomcat etc.) are patched manually on a schedule documented on Confluence as part of the Run Book: <https://digital.dclg.gov.uk/confluence/display/DT/Infrastructure+patching>
